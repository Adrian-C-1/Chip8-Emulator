# Chip8 Emulator/ Interpreter

This is a Chip8 Emulator/ Interpreter I made over a few days in order to learn the basics of emulation. 
Kudos to [Cowgod](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) for the technical refrence.

Made using C++ and SDL2.

I am by no way an experienced programmer so I may not have followed the best practices. But it seems to work fine with ROMs I tested ([dmatlack](https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master/roms/games)).

## Usage

In order to open a ROM, open with any text editor and read the instructions located at Files/config.
The file Files/log.txt is only used for debug purposes.

## Possible future features:
Even though there is some room for future improvement (stated below), I doubt I will continue working on this project.
- File dialog for choosing the ROM (SDL does not have a way for this, would need another library)
- Better audio (again, would need another library)
- Custom keyboard input
